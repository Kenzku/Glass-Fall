Glass-Fall
==========

This is a personal project that I do after school and usually in the evening. 
The development code is called `Glass Fall`, but this is a project that will fetch URL from a default webpage on `Node.js`,
then it will send fetched URLs to the browser. 

Currently, it only supports desktop verson, and mobile version is under construction :) if I still have time after school.

The desktop version enables showing URLs by search a HTML page or pictures, currently, other application document will be 
downloaded by your web brosers by default. 

Your traces will be save to my CouchDB by default, and alternative, you can switch to save to a file, but I haven't 
enabled it. 

## Build the app

To sreve the application you need a server running Node.js with NPM installed. Step to get the web server running:

    cd WAMP-Tryout
    npm install
    node app.js

**The application is still under development** and it does not work yet.
