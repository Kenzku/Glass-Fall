Glass-Fall
==========

This is a personal project that I do after school and usually in the evening. The development code is called Glass Fall, but this is a project that will fetch URL from a default webpage on Node.js, then it will send fetched URLs to the browser. 

## Build the app

To sreve the application you need a server running Node.js with NPM installed. Step to get the web server running:

    cd WAMP-Tryout
    npm install
    node app.js

**The application is still under development** and it does not work yet.
